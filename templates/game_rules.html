                <p>Gotcha, also known as Killer, is a thrilling party game that encourages stealth, cunning, and subterfuge among players. The game can be played by a large group of people, making it an ideal choice for social gatherings or team-building events. The objective of the game is simple: players must discreetly eliminate their assigned targets with a toy gun while simultaneously avoiding elimination themselves. The last player standing wins the game.</p>

                <h2 class="fw-bold">Setup:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Number of players: Gotcha is best played with a group of at least 5 to 6 players, but can be enjoyed by a much larger group as well.</li>
                    <li>Materials: You will need toy guns for each player and a method for assigning targets, such as a mobile app or pre-determined list.</li>
                    <li>Preparation: Ensure that each player has a toy gun and knows their assigned target. Targets can be assigned using a mobile app or pre-determined list, ensuring that no player is assigned themselves as a target.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="fw-bold">Game Rules:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Elimination method: Players must discreetly seek out and eliminate their targets by "shooting" them with their toy gun without being seen by any other players or bystanders.</li>
                    <li>Target elimination: When a player eliminates their target, they inherit their target's assignment. For example, if Player A eliminates Player B, Player A now takes on Player B's target as their new assignment.</li>
                    <li>Out-of-bounds areas: Designate areas where eliminations are not allowed, such as restrooms or busy public spaces. This ensures safety and avoids causing discomfort or disruption for bystanders.</li>
                    <li>Witnesses: If a player is caught in the act of eliminating their target by another player, the elimination is void. The target remains in the game and the "assassin" must try again later.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Winning the Game:</h2>
            <p>The game continues until only one player remains. This player is declared the winner, having successfully eliminated their targets while avoiding their own elimination.</p>

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Variations and House Rules:</h2>
            <p>Gotcha is a versatile game that can be adapted to suit different groups and preferences. Here are some popular variations and house rules:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Time Limit: Set a time limit for the game, such as a few hours or even a few days. If no winner emerges by the deadline, the player with the most eliminations wins.</li>
                <li>Special Powers: Introduce special powers or abilities, such as a one-time-use "shield" that allows a player to avoid elimination.</li>
                <li>Teams: Divide players into teams, with the objective of eliminating all members of the opposing team(s) before losing all of your own team members.</li>
            </ol>
